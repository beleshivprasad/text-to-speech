# text-to-speech
To implement this project, I have used the basic concepts of Python, Tkinter, gTTS, and playsound libraries.

Tkinter is a standard GUI Python library that is one of the fastest and easiest ways to build GUI applications using Tkinter.
gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) is a Python library, which is a very easy library that converts the text into audio.
The playsound module is used to play audio files. With this module, we can play a sound file with a single line of code.

At the end this app will convert text to sound i.e. speech

Edited with the help of test branch.
